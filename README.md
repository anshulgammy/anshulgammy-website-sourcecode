# Anshul Gautam's Website
Codebase for my website at https://www.anshulgautam.in/. This is my personal website and technical blog.

## This website is powered by:
[Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) static site generator, and using [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) as the base theme. I have made changes to Papermod theme wherever I found necessary.
