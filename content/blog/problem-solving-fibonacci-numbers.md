## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
Fibonacci Numbers are series of numbers: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...`

The first fibonacci number in the series is: `0`.

The second fibonacci number in the series is: `1`.

From the third number and onwards in the series, we can get that number by adding the previous two fibonacci numbers.
So the third fibonacci number will be: `0 + 1 = 1`.

The fourth fibonacci number in the series will be: `1 + 1 = 2`.

The fifth fibonacci number in the series will be: `1 + 2 = 3`.
.

.
and so on.

## ðŸŽ¯ Solving the problem in Java

**Problem Statement**: Write a Java program to print first â€˜nâ€™ Fibonacci Numbers.

```
/**
 * Problem 1: Write a Java program to print first â€˜nâ€™ Fibonacci Numbers.
 */
public class Problem_1 {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    System.out.println("Enter the value for n:");
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    int n = sc.nextInt();

    int firstNumber = 0;
    int secondNumber = 1;
    int currentNumber;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      System.out.print(firstNumber + " ");
      currentNumber = firstNumber + secondNumber;
      firstNumber = secondNumber;
      secondNumber = currentNumber;
    }
  }
}
```
