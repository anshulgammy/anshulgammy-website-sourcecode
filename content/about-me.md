*Hi!ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by!*

My name is **Anshul Gautam**.

I grew up in [Patna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna), capital of Bihar state in India. I have been working as a **Software Engineer** since 2014, after completing my **B-Tech** in **Computer Science & Engineering** (class of 2010-2014).

As a Software Engineer I have extensively worked on designing and building scalable distributed enterprise applications in **Media** and **Finance** business domains.
I have expertise in **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Reactive Programming** and **Microservices** architectured applications. During my journey, I have worked on relational database systems like **MS-SQL Server** and non-relational database systems like **Cassandara** and **Couchbase**.

Currently I am focussing on building fault tolerant data ingestion frameworks in **Finance** business domain using **Java**, **Apache Kafka** and **Big Data Technologies** from **Hadoop Ecosystem**.

On the internet I am also active as a **Blogger**. I mostly blog about **Software Development**, write **Short Stories** and **Verselets**. Most of the blog posts on this website are related to tools, techniques and use cases from the field of Software Development and Engineering.
